# RSA Encryption and Decryption with Tkinter GUI

## Description
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for RSA encryption and decryption using Python's tkinter library. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely-used public key cryptographic algorithm. The GUI allows users to input messages, encrypt them using a public key, and decrypt them using a private key.

## Features
- RSA key generation
- RSA encryption and decryption
- Simple and intuitive tkinter GUI

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tk
```
