<h2> RSA Encryption and Decryption with Tkinter GUI </h2>
 
## Description
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for RSA encryption and decryption using Python's tkinter library. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely-used public key cryptographic algorithm. The GUI allows users to input messages, encrypt them using a public key, and decrypt them using a private key.

## Features
- RSA key generation
- RSA encryption and decryption
- Simple and intuitive tkinter GUI

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaikrish-24/Encdecpy.git
```

2. Install packages required for the tool.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the backend server.
```bash
python Enc.py
```

4. Use the GUI to:
 - Generate RSA keys.
 - Encrypt a message using the public key.
 - Decrypt a message using the private key.
